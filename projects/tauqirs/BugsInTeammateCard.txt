Bug Report 1
Where: In the smithy function when cardEffect is called with smithy as the option. In my usage I call cardEffect after using initializeGame.
Error: The loop condition checks for > 3 rather than < 3 so first few iterations will get skipped. This should cause an infinite loop.
Expected: It is expected that the player will pick up 3 cards into their hand and have 8 cards in their hand at this point.

Bug Report 2
Where: In the adventurer funciton when cardEffect is called with adventurer as the option. In my usage I call cardEffect after using initializeGame.
Error: The gold card is not being considered a treasure card when trying to reveal 2 treasure cards in your card and putting them into your hand.
Expected: It is expected that gold, silver and copper are all counted as treasure cards and that the player stops revealing cards once they have revealed 2 treasure cards.

Bug Report 3
Where: In the village function when cardEffect is called with village as the option. In my usage I call cardEffect after using initializeGame.
Error: This function is discarding the other players card at the end of the turn rather than the current players card.
Expected: This function should only discard the current players card and make no changes to the cards in any other players' hands. It is invalid for a player to have -1 cards in their hand.
